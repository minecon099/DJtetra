# ExodiusTools
The replacement for the old DJtetra which in the end returned to be an unsuccessful project that in the end would remain incomplete, now it is called ExodiusTools, a multipurpose bot that has different functions, like simple commands such as ping pong command or more complex that use an API such as inspire command, which sends an inspirational quote from the webside zenquotes.io, this time, we are also implementing the use of slash commands, cogs and much more!

## What's new:
### Changelog:
- **Screw discord.py**, it's old and no longer mantained by the owner. **We are using Nextcord.py** now, it has a more active support and it allows us to make Slash Commands n' other interactions.
- **Protect your Bot token** with dotenv! - Now you'll be safer with an enviroment variable file at hand to run with your private credentials.
- **Cogs!** - An OOP based module that allows us to separate the commands within different files, now all the family can have modules properly separated in different files.
- We've added even **more command examples**, such as Roleplay commands with nekos.best API or Dad Jokes with @icanhazdadjoke's DadJokes API.
- **New file organization!** - As of discord eventually removing prefix based commands for unverified bots, we'll have a separated file with the old version. It'll remain archived but probably no longer updated.
- Removed ZenQuotes.io's inspire command. Sorry, but until I find the appropiate solution for cooldowns, it'll be removed until further notice.

### TODO List:
- Add Slash Commands with arguments ❎
- Add Cooldown for some commands ❎
- Add Cogs ❎
- Re-code old version into Slash Commands ❎
- Add Roleplay Commands ❎
- Add File Organization ❎

## Description:
### What is this new thing?
It is a more complex project that now includes some embed sending properties, Kick, Ban and Unbanning commands, API example which is useful for first timers in json modules and API usages, and some additional info so that discord.py users can start with

### What do we expect from it?
It will most likely have music functions unless Discord's Watch Together activity comes out, custom presence messages like competing in (message) or more advanced like a custom status, even more moderation tools like banned words, mute command, assign a role to a user and more fun commands like Dank Memer's meme command and economy functions too

### When will it be released to public?
We expect to release a definitive version in Late 2022 and we will release an official bot and that time for a limited amount of Discord Guilds

### What can I do with this code?
You may use this code for whatever you want, you may redistribute it only if you place my name on it, you may modify it and change the bot's prefix at will, its embeds and its content, the APIs and its import modules, but be sure to always give credit to the author (me) in your redistributions and things, but do not attempt to sell it as this product is already free and open source to everyone
