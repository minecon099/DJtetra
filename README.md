This is a Public bot that uses Discord.py to send messages to discord, react to commands and other stuff, this will be constantly under updates, plus, it is an open code so you can learn how any of the Discord.py functions work

Some of the things that you may find confusing are easily explainable
1. The client.run() line is with "Token goes here" so you can test it at your own
2. The channel IDs are with ChannelID so you can place your own IDs of the channels you prefer
3. Most importantly, I would like you to compromise at not editing Version command as it is of lots of importance to the users that operate the bot :]

This bot was made with the help of a fellow youtuber I will explain later when my code is finished and inspirations from @ElCholoGamer, a guy that made his own repository with the Josuke bot, made with Typescript and other stuff which inspired me on making this with the help of Discord.py
