# ExodiusTools
The replacement for the old DJtetra which in the end returned to be an unsuccessful project that in the end would remain incomplete, now it is called ExodiusTools, a multipurpose bot that has different functions, like simple commands such as ping pong command or more complex that use aiohttp to send API requests or Cogs that allow you to separate your commands into multiple files that you can load and disable remotely!

## What's new:
### Changelog (v1.1.2 The Colorful Present bugs update!):
- Added a "randomcolor" command, with this you can get a totally random generated color in RGB and HEX code, also displayed in the embed's color!
- Added **presence** module! - Now Exodius Bot can display a custom status with cogs! (Yea I placed that myself, this became a pretty hard job lol)
- Added **aiohttp** import! - We'll soon rework the API system, you know what that means as well (*Cooldown incoming*)
- Fixed a bug where "neko", "kitsune" and "waifu" commands would show a smol image instead of the original size (Yup, silly me forgot to change thumbnail to image!)
- Fixed the "rock" command. Now you can get sweet rock pics, either gifs or just images or recolors I dunno I didn't make the API.

### TODO List:
- Add Slash Commands ✅
  - Re-code old version into Slash Commands ❎
  - Add Slash Commands with arguments ❎
  - Add Descriptions for arguments ❎ (But sorta completed anyway)
  - Add Cooldown for some commands ❎
  - Add Roleplay Commands ❎
  - Add Slash Command Categories ❎
  - Fix "rock" command ✅
- Add Cogs ✅
  - Add an option to disable and enable cogs individually [EDIT: This will only be available for bot owners, pubilc version will not include this feature.]❎

## Description:
### What is this new thing?
It is a more complex project that now includes some embed sending properties, Kick, Ban and Unbanning commands, API example which is useful for first timers in json modules and API usages, and some additional info so that discord.py users can start with

### What do we expect from it?
It will most likely have music functions (unless Discord's Watch Together activity comes out and bans all music bots), custom presence messages, even more moderation tools like banned words, assign a role to a user, reaction roles and more fun commands like custom economy with Databases support. (JSON it not good for Databases!)

### When will it be released to public?
We expect to release a definitive version in Late 2022 and we will release an official bot (Probably different from this) publicly and a Testing Version into our eventual Discord Community.

### What can I do with this code?
Use this as much as you'd like, just make sure to credit me if you use some snippets or just literally all the code (I don't mind lol) even if they are slight or major changes. Or just refer to the license terms of [Creative Commons BY 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/)
