# ExodiusTools
The replacement for the old DJtetra which in the end returned to be an unsuccessful project that in the end would remain incomplete, now it is called ExodiusTools, a multipurpose bot that has different functions, like simple commands such as ping pong command or more complex that use aiohttps to send API requests or Cogs that allow you to separate your commands into multiple files that you can load and disable remotely!

## What's new:
### Changelog (v1.1 The Slash-Neko-OOP update):
- We've added **cogs** to the code, now I've played a bit with the importing settings and after a few more times of trying to get cogs to work and some **help from Nextcord Discord Community** I managed to make a few extensions called "fun.py" and "images.py" which consist in a handful of commands for image posting and other fun tools.
- We got **slash commands wooooo!** - After a bunch of updates from Nextcord we got the news that it handles Slash commands as fine as water, plus we got 1 example of commands with arguments in our code!
- We got new commands from nekos.best API - You can now not only get Nekos but also Kitsune and Waifu art, SFW of course, I'm not an internet weirdo!
- Fixed childish nonsense speech in README.md, yeah I just didn't knew how to write good files to explain this.

## Description:
### What is this new thing?
It is a more complex project that now includes some embed sending properties, Kick, Ban and Unbanning commands, API example which is useful for first timers in json modules and API usages, and some additional info so that discord.py users can start with

### What do we expect from it?
It will most likely have music functions (unless Discord's Watch Together activity comes out and bans all music bots), custom presence messages, even more moderation tools like banned words, assign a role to a user, reaction roles and more fun commands like custom economy with Databases support. (JSON it not good for Databases!)

### When will it be released to public?
We expect to release a definitive version in Late 2022 and we will release an official bot (Probably different from this) publicly and a Testing Version into our eventual Discord Community.

### What can I do with this code?
Use this as much as you'd like, just make sure to credit me if you use some snippets or just literally all the code (I don't mind lol) even if they are slight or major changes. Or just refer to the license terms of [Creative Commons BY 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/)
